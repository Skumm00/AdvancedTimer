An Advanced Timer in python in which you can use it for many things such as keeping track of what you're doing like a project or some other work. To run it, download or clone the repo, open it in your profered text editor(I use VS Code) and then run the program and you can interact with it in the console.

You can also just use the github release and download it,export the zip file and open it from there
